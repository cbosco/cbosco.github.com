<p>
OpenBox is an easy-to-implement in-page popup window, similar to the popular image gallery tool, <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox</a>, except that OpenBox can present any type of content. OpenBox uses unobtrusive Javascript and is powered by the lightweight <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a> Javascript framework.

OpenBox is highly configurable and is targeted towards web designers who are comfortable with CSS and HTML and have a little exposure to Javascript (OpenBox does all the heavy lifting).
