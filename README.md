# chrisbosco.com source

This project powers my personal homepage at chrisbosco.com. It is a (crude) static-site generator based around Markdown and JSON metadata, which I am hoping is easier to maintain than the original portfolio page that started as PHP/MySQL.

It is also a work-in-progress conversion to [brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Special Thanks
